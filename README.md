IMARE
=====

IMARE is a set of tools for accurate sound transcription. It was developed as a
group programming project at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń in
2010 under supervision of Michał Dudkiewicz and was awarded 1st price at annual
faculty competitions.

The project's code is stored in three separate repositories:

* **[imare](https://github.com/ImareTeam/imare)**
with a full (original) version of the software, but maybe a little outdated

* **[imare-lite](https://github.com/ImareTeam/imare-lite)**
with a alternative version of a software with slightly limited functionality,
but improved user interface and general usability

* **[audio-recognition-library](https://github.com/ImareTeam/audio-recognition-library)**
with a core library used by other two for audio processing and transcription

published in the inter-disciplinary conference proceedings
(ISBN 978-83-63058-00-5) or
[the poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImareTeam/audio-recognition-library/master/docs/imare-poster-pl.pdf)
presented at the same conference. Unfortunately, both materials are in Polish.
